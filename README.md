#### The notebooks posted are related to web scraping two websites, NCBI and HealthPayer.
Flow:
1. Web scraping the headline, article link and posted date.
2. Filtering the article sposted in the past one month
3. Scraping the full article using the article link.
4. Searching for a specific team needed, in my case it's 'Medicare Advantage'
